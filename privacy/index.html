<h2 id="cookies-and-other-browser-information">Cookies and Other Browser Information</h2>

<p>KubeVirt’s online services automatically capture IP addresses. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with our services. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your location, in order to provide you data and content from our services as quickly as possible. It is in KubeVirt’s legitimate business interest to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of its services for all users.</p>

<p>As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, KubeVirt uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. All sections of kubevirt.io where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require your browser to accept cookies.</p>

<p>Generally, we use cookies to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to provide a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or “sign in” and is modified when you “sign out” of our services.</li>
  <li>Estimate audience size. Each browser accessing KubeVirt is given a unique cookie that is used to determine the extent of repeat usage and usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user.</li>
  <li>Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of KubeVirt’s network of websites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our user’s habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on kubevirt.io a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions you and other users will see on our sites.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time if you accept them or not. However, you must understand that the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain services, and choosing to reject cookies will reduce the performance and functionality of the site. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located in the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility).</p>

<h2 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h2>

<p>In addition to other cookies, our project uses Google Analytics to track your website activity, including times, IP addresses, and pages visited.  We do this in order to track, and report on, our success in promoting our project and website.  While we are happy to remove any personal data which is under our control in Google Analytics at your request, you may also need to <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/compliance/#?modal_active=none">contact Google</a> about removing data from their servers.</p>

<h2 id="public-forums-reminder">Public Forums Reminder</h2>

<p>KubeVirt often makes chat rooms, forums, mailing lists, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal data. Although we value individual ideas and encourage free expression, KubeVirt reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve the integrity of these areas, such as removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate. It is in KubeVirt’s legitimate business interests to provide all users an accurate record of data and content provided in the public forums it maintains and uses; to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes; and to provide an environment for the free exchange of ideas relevant and constructive to the development and propagation of open source software.</p>

<h2 id="our-commitment-to-childrens-online-privacy">Our Commitment to Children’s Online Privacy</h2>

<p>Out of special concern for children’s privacy, KubeVirt does not knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of 13. KubeVirt does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites. KubeVirt does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13.</p>

<p>In the event that KubeVirt ever decides to expand its intended site audience to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice addressed to children under 13. In addition, KubeVirt will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children’s personal information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.</p>

If you wish to withdraw consent that you have previously provided to KubeVirt, you may do so by <a href="mailto:privacy@kubevirt.io">contacting our privacy team</a>. However, the withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
